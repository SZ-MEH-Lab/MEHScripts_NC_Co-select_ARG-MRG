# This is the machine learning code for training the best predictive model (Random Forest).

# Usage:
1. download the example data ("ML_rf_model.demo.xlsx") and the Python script ("ML_rf_model.py") to the same path.
2. Run the Python code with "python ML_rf_model.py" in the Windows command line tool or Linux command line.
3. After running the Python script successfully, it will generate the best model (best_estimator_rf.joblib) and output the precision, accuracy, recall and F1 score of the model prediction.
4. At the same time will also generate confusion matrix and ROC curve to further judge the model prediction performance.

Please note that the results of machine learning need to be adjusted according to the situation, especially the hyperparameters, and the optimal model is adjusted many times.
